As if this writing, the status of this component is: theoretical, this is all
wishfull thinking.

A filesystem component for the k operating system, inspired by
[Nayuki's](https://www.nayuki.io/page/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies)
tag based filesystem post.

It uses a traditional filesystem for actually storing the files, and caches tag
info in sqlite for faster querying.

As a component of the k operating system, the main way of interacting with it is
over a capnproto RPC interface.

It's object-oriented interface is inspired by django's ORM.

nayukiFs addresses content using hashes, so it is defacto copy-on-write. A
provision for temporary and special files, addressable via UUID, is intended.
A convenience method, `.latest()`, should be used to get the latest file
matching a query.

There's also intended to be a tag-based message-passing system, similar in usage
to mqtt.

Tags are somewhat complicated. Tags can be a namespace, storing a piece of
metadata. For example, the tag `ctime:1529250290` would be perfectly valid. Of
course in a user-interface you probably want to represent that as something
human-readable.

# Building

We use tup as our build system. If you just want to get this installed, and not
do actual development, you can use the `quickBuild.sh` generated by tup to
build, even if you don't have tup installed.

Whenever you make significant changes, please run `tup generate quickBuild.sh`
to update the quickbuild.

Building requires several command line tools.

 * Nim, the compiler for the nim language (which itself relies on gcc)
 * Nimble, the nim-lang package manager
 * capnp, the code generator for the capnproto schema language
 * [capnp-nim](https://github.com/zielmicha/capnp.nim), the nim-lang extentions
   for capnproto. 

# Architecture

At it's core, NayukiFs is a [content-addressable
storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-addressable_storage) system.
